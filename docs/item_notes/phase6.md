# Clockspeed - live per-item detail, phase 6 - surfaces

**Section status: LIVE.** A dated heading in this file records provenance - when the
text was filed, moved or measured - and never that the section itself is historical.

**This is a leaf of `docs/item_notes.md`**, which owns the index and the rules this
file obeys. Read the index for the routing table over every OPEN item, the verbatim
rule, and what this family never contains. Do not restate any of it here.

**What lands in THIS leaf.** Every OPEN item ROADMAP.md files under its `Phase 6` heading.

**THIS LEAF IS YOUNGER THAN ITS SIBLINGS AND ITS BODIES DID NOT COME FROM THE SPLIT.**
Phase 6 carried no leaf until the sections below were written, so every one of them
arrived from an item LINE in `ROADMAP.md` rather than from `docs/item_notes.md` or
`docs/history_notes.md`. A body here is the text that used to sit on the line, moved
rather than deleted, and it is a LIVE INSTRUCTION for the same reason a sibling's is.

**When an item CLOSES its section moves to `docs/history_notes.md`**, not to another
leaf. That move is what keeps this file live.

## CS-609

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

The item line carried its counts and its second site inline. Both moved here so the line
holds the fault and the acceptance alone.

`_spellings_of()` produces FOUR spellings, and collapses them to ONE where the path
carries no backslash - which is every path on the every-push lane. The derivation now
records that collapse, so the fact is not lost at the point it happens.

**WHAT IS STILL UNRECORDED IS THE CONSUMPTION, AND THAT IS THE ITEM.** Two consumers
read the collapsed set - the detector, and the A6 production sweep - and each therefore
grades A QUARTER as much on that lane as a reader of a green run would assume. Neither
site records the collapse where it consumes it. The acceptance admits either remedy:
derive the spellings from what the running platform can actually produce, or record the
collapse at the point of use.

## CS-614

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

The arm is
`test_run_exits_non_zero_on_a_bind_failure_and_binds_nothing_else`.

**THE MECHANISM.** It asserts over EVERY thread in the process whose name contains
`serve`, and CPython folds a target's function name into the DEFAULT thread name. So a
thread another test started with `serve_forever` as its target and never joined carries
`serve` in its name through no intent of anyone, and this arm counts it.

**WHY THE FAILURE IS WORSE THAN THE FLAKE.** The arm's message blames a failed bind. A
reader of the red therefore investigates the bind path, which is not where the fault is.
The acceptance asks the arm to count only the threads its own call created, or to
distinguish a pre-existing one and NAME it - either remedy makes the message true.

## CS-615

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

The counts moved off the line; they are measured values and the line is not their owner.

The tier-2 count floor is `tests > 0` POOLED over FIVE suites, and the per-file liveness
arm asks only for one `test(` in each file. A pooled floor is met by its strongest member,
so the two together admit a tree in which all five suites are one-test stubs: every lane
stays green with 169 of 174 arms gone.

**THE ACCEPTANCE DELIBERATELY REFUSES A LITERAL.** An expected count written as a number
in the guard is the same defect one level along - it drifts the first time a suite gains
an arm. The count has to come from a recorded per-suite declaration.

## CS-616

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

**THE THREE STATEMENTS, AND WHERE EACH ONE LIVES.**

- `shell/lib/trust.js` and `shell/main.js` both state that `callback(0)` switches
  Certificate Transparency off for the WHOLE SESSION.
- The same file states that DEFER leaves full validation on.
- ADR 0014 headlines that nothing is disabled wholesale.

**THEY CANNOT ALL HOLD.** TRUST fires on the only page load, so if `callback(0)` really
is session-scoped then the second and third statements are false from that moment on.
The question is a fact about a running Electron, not about the source: settle it against
one.

**IF IT CANNOT BE SETTLED, THE CLAIM COMES OUT OF ALL THREE PLACES** and the
unverifiability is recorded in THIS section. Do not leave one of the three standing on
the grounds that it is the one that happens to be written most carefully.

## CS-618

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

`shell/lib/state.js` interpolates untrusted state-file content VERBATIM into its fault
strings. The measured instance is the `schema` property: a planted `schema` value renders
a home path or a world name into a message, which non-negotiables 11 and 12 forbid
regardless of how the value got into the file.

**THE SIBLING ALREADY SHOWS THE SHAPE OF THE FIX.** `endpoint.js` makes the same property
a CONSTRUCTOR INVARIANT over a CLOSED FAULT SET, so no caller-supplied text reaches a
message at all. That is the same closed-vocabulary idiom `clockspeed/surface/config.py`
states, and the acceptance names it so the remedy is not re-derived from scratch.

## CS-619

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

`shell/main.js` and `shell/preload.js` are executed by NO test in either language. What
that leaves ungraded, enumerated so the acceptance's "whichever parts are pure" has
something to be measured against:

- the verify-proc installation
- the CSS injection
- the debounce
- the close flush
- the certificate refusal path

`node --check` and the static scans are the only things reading these files today, and
neither executes a line.

**ADR 0014 FRAMES THE UNGRADED SET AS DISPLAY-BOUND**, which the list above contradicts -
the certificate refusal path is not a display concern. The acceptance requires that
framing to change as part of closing this item, so the ADR stops arguing for a gap that
is wider than it says.

## CS-872

### Relocated from `ROADMAP.md` 2026-09-01

The composed page opens with no default keyboard scrolling, because a NON-ROOT SCROLLER
is not the default scroll target.

**WHY THIS NEEDS A REAL ELECTRON RUN TO GRADE.** The acceptance asks for a cold key press
to scroll the composed page with the band still covering no content. The band is a DRAG
REGION THE OS DRAWS OUTSIDE THE WEB CONTENTS, so no headless or in-page harness can
observe both halves of that condition at once - the scroll is observable in the web
contents and the band is not. Grading it means running the shell.
## CS-887

### NOTE - filed 2026-09-03 (session 57) by the merger, MEASURED BEFORE FILING, from a CS-882 builder

**THE SAME FAULT FAMILY AS CS-882, AND THIS ONE HAS A LIVE WRONG INSTRUCTION IN THE
RUNBOOK.** CS-882 fixed `scripts/make_cert.py`, whose colliding table was a module
docstring. This module's table is in `docs/OPERATIONS.md` section 7.3, which is what an
operator actually reads at a failure.

**MEASURED AT 528d5b6, NOT READ.** `python -m clockspeed.surface
--clockspeed-not-a-real-flag` exits 2. `docs/OPERATIONS.md` documents 2 as the port
refusal and instructs: find what holds it, or pass `--port`. A mistyped flag therefore
sends the reader to look for a process holding a port that was never bound. The same
sweep measured `--help` exiting 0 against a documented clean stop.

**THE TABLE CLAIMS COMPLETENESS**, which is what turns a gap into a false statement:
`docs/OPERATIONS.md` says anything outside it is a malfunction rather than a refusal. A
usage error is a refusal, is outside the table, and is not a malfunction.

**THE CODES ARE DECLARED, BUT ACROSS TWO MODULES.** `clockspeed/surface/__main__.py`
declares `EXIT_CONFIG`; `clockspeed/surface/server.py` declares `EXIT_OK`,
`EXIT_BIND_FAILED` and `EXIT_CERTIFICATE`. argparse owns 0 and 2 for its own outcomes and
neither module declares them for those outcomes, so a derivation over the declarations
alone cannot see the collision. That split is why the acceptance says the two modules.

**`--help` EXITING 0 IS DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE.** The operator ruled in session 57,
on the CS-882 repair, that `--help` must exit 0 and that POSIX convention outranks a
distinctness universal for that one pair. Do not widen this item to move it, and do not
cite CS-882's arm as precedent for doing so - CS-882 ships that pair as a stated,
reasoned exemption rather than as a met universal.

**DO NOT FOLD THIS INTO CS-604.** That item is about `docs/OPERATIONS.md` restating the
port BAND that `config/ports.json` owns. Same file, different owner and different fact.

**A THIRD SITE WAS MEASURED AND IS NOT FILED.** `scripts/verify_env.py` also exits 2 on a
bad flag, but publishes no exit-code table, so nothing collides there today. Recorded so a
later reader knows it was looked at rather than missed.
